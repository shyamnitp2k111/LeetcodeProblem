We are writing software to collect and manage data on how fast racers can complete obstacle courses. An obstacle course is a series of difficult physical challenges (like walls, hurdles, and ponds) that a racer must go through.

Each course consists of multiple obstacles. The software stores how long it takes for racers to finish each obstacle, and provides useful statistics based on those times.

Definitions:

* A "run" is a particular attempt to complete an entire obstacle course

* A "run collection" is a group of runs on a particular course by the user.

* An "obstacle" is a portion of a course. We track how long it takes to finish each portion of the course

For example, here are some times for an obstacle course with four obstacles:

Obstacles:    O1  O2  O3  O4

    Run 1:      3   4   5   6    (total: 18 seconds)

    Run 2:      4   4   4   5    (total: 17 seconds)

    Run 3:      4   5   4   6    (total: 19 seconds)

    Run 4:      5   5   3      (13 seconds, but run is incomplete)

All of these runs for one obstacle course (including the incomplete run) make up a run collection.

To begin with, we present you with two tasks:

1-1) Read through and understand the code below. Please take as much time as necessary, and feel free to run the code.

1-2) The test for RunCollection is not passing due to a bug in the code. Make the necessary changes to RunCollection to fix the bug.


2) We would like to implement a new function in RunCollection called "bestOfBests". This is a measure of how fast a run could be if everything went perfectly, and is determined by taking the fastest times for each obstacle across all runs (even incomplete ones) and summing them. In the run collection above, the times 3, 4, 3, and 5 combine to make a best of bests run of 15 seconds.

Implement this function, and add a test to verify that it works.

2-2) What other tests would you implement?


3) We would like to implement a new function "chanceOfPersonalBest". This

   takes in an in-progress Run object, and determines the chance that this run

   will be a new personal best, or match the current personal best.

   This assumes that, for every obstacle after the obstacles already completed

   in the run, the time to complete that obstacle is uniformly chosen from times

   to complete that obstacle in all other runs.

   We want to do this using simulation. To do this, write a method in

   RunCollection that takes in an in-progress run and does the

   following:

   * Over 10,000 trials:

     * For each incomplete segment in the current run:

       * Select a time randomly from previous runs (including incomplete runs)

     * Check if the run, including randomly collected times, is better than or matching

       the current personal best

   * Return the chance, over those trials, that the run was a personal best.

   The solution should consistently return a solution within .02 of the correct

   solutions. For example, if there is a .5 (50%) chance of a personal best, the

   function should return a value between .48 and .52.
